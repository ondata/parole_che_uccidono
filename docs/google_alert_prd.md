## Periodic RSS Feed Update Verification

- **User Story**:

As a user, I want the system to periodically check my RSS feeds for updates using a GitHub Action workflow that runs a script, so that the process is fully automated and managed within a GitHub repository.
The feed url is https://www.google.com/alerts/feeds/15244278077982194024/11541540114411201767

## Archiving Feed Entries in JSONL Format

- **User Story**:

As a user, I want the system to extract the `<id>`, `<title>`, `<link>`, and `<published>` fields from RSS feed entries and archive them into a `.jsonl` file, so I have a clean and structured record.

## Avoiding Duplicate Entries in the Archive

- **User Story**:

As a user, I want the script to check for existing entry `<id>` values in the JSONL archive before saving new data to ensure no duplicate entries are stored.

## Sorting Archived Entries by Publication Date in Descending Order:

- **User Story**:

As a user, I want the script to sort the `.jsonl` archive by the `<published>` field in descending order, so that the most recent entries always appear at the top of the file.

## Implementation

### Python Script

The implementation uses Python with libraries such as `requests`, `lxml`, and `json` to handle the feed processing in a robust way:

- **Feed Download**: Uses the `requests` library to fetch the RSS feed
- **XML Parsing**: Uses `lxml` for efficient and reliable XML parsing with namespace support
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts the required fields from the feed entries
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing entries before adding new ones
- **Sorting**: Orders entries by publication date in descending order
- **Error Handling**: Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

This approach provides good maintainability, thorough error handling, and detailed debugging capabilities.
